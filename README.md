# Producer-Consumer
This is a simple Producer Consumer demo.I have created 2 threads , 1 for producer, 1 for consumer and 1 main thread is 
automatically created by the process.Producer produces the data. Once data is available, the consumer consumes the data and goes back to 
sleep till the producer signals to wake up. While consumer is consuming, producer is sleeping. 
While producer is producing, the consumer sleeps. Its written in C language.
